Please download face-api.js model files and place them in this 'public/models' directory.
For real-time face detection, you'll typically need:
- Tiny Face Detector models (e.g., tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json and associated .shard files)
- Optionally, for landmarks: Face Landmark 68 Tiny Model (face_landmark_68_tiny_model-weights_manifest.json and shards)

You can find these models in the face-api.js GitHub repository (weights directory) or other online sources providing these pre-trained models.
The application will attempt to load them from '/models/your_model_file'.
Ensure the file names match what face-api.js expects (e.g., tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json).
